Right now I'm thinking about how I want to structure this. Ultimately I want want it to be almost exactly like fitnotes but
having a section that shows you info on how you are progressing. So I'm thinking about having a data section where I do all the cool stuff. The logs section will be were new data is stored for lifts. As for the exercises themselves those have to be in there own category. 

Making some progress Right now I just got to figure out how to get column names and apply them when creating a new csv. I've
Figured out how to create new csvs from the names of exercises from the names column but now I have to just create them using
different column names. It's a pretty dumb way tbh but I will figure the better way to do it.
